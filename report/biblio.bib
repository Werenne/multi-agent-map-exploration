abstract="Multi-robot mapping and exploration involves a team of mobile robots cooperating autonomously to discover information about an area, construct a coherent geometric map of the area, and find other relevant objects in the area, e.g., people or machinery. Additionally, the team must interact with humans, both to send them useful information, and to accept commands influence their mission. Making the physical robots into agents, and connecting them with other software agents for control and communication, enables us to dynamically configure and task a complex system.",
